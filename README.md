  <h1>Lunalite: Understanding Light Pollution</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What is light pollution?</h2>
    <p>Light pollution occurs when artificial lights excessively brighten the sky, reducing our view of the stars. It also plays a huge role in why people cannot get as much sleep. For example, urban areas with many streetlights make it harder to see any stars.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What are the causes of light pollution?</h2>
    <p>The main cause of light pollution is excessive or poorly designed artificial lights. When lights from streets, buildings, and cars are on, they shine in all directions and brighten the sky.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What are the impacts of light pollution?</h2>
    <p>Light pollution negatively affects both humans and the environment. People do not get as much sleep, which means they are less productive the next day. It also disrupts animals and ecosystems, altering their nighttime environment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What can we do to stop light pollution?</h2>
    <p>To prevent light pollution, use only necessary lighting, choose the right lightbulb, turn off lights when not in use, and make sure they are not too bright unless beneficial.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why is it important to maintain your regular sleep cycle?</h2>
    <p>Maintaining your regular sleep cycle is crucial as it supports brain function, balances your mood, and boosts your immune system.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What happens if you do not get enough sleep?</h2>
    <p>If your body does not get enough sleep, you can experience chronic sleep deprivation. This can lead to a shortened attention span, depression, concentration difficulties, and more.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Which light is more efficient: LED or incandescent?</h2>
    <p>LED lights are more efficient because they use less electricity, last longer, and do not waste energy as heat. Incandescent lights use more energy and burn out faster.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why does light make it difficult to sleep?</h2>
    <p>Exposure to light during sleep disrupts your body's circadian rhythm, which is your internal clock. Light affects melatonin production, a crucial hormone for sleeping.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Different types of light pollution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="blue-text">Blue light</span> – when the light is blue</li>
      <li><span class="blue-text">Glare</span> – when light is too bright and makes it hard to see</li>
      <li><span class="blue-text">Skyglow</span> – when the night sky looks bright because of city lights</li>
      <li><span class="blue-text">Light trespass</span> – when light shines where it’s not wanted, like into your window</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
    <p>Light pollution makes the sky too bright, so astronomers can't see stars clearly. This makes it harder to study space and discover new things. That’s why observatories are often built far away from city lights.</p>
